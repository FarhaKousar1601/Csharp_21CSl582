This repository contains C# programming laboratory experiments designed for VTU under subcode 21CSL582. The experiments cover a range of topics and concepts in C# programming.

## Experiments Included

1. **Simple Arithmetic Calculator**: A program to perform basic arithmetic operations like Addition, Subtraction, Multiplication, Division, and Modulus.
2. **Armstrong Number**: Find Armstrong numbers between 1 to 1000.
3. **Substring Listing**: List all substrings in a given string.
4. **Exception Handling**: Demonstrate Division by Zero and Index Out of Range exceptions.
5. **Pascal Triangle**: Generate and print Pascal Triangle using Two-Dimensional arrays.
6. **Floyd's Triangle**: Generate and print Floyd's Triangle using Jagged arrays.
7. **File Handling**: Read a text file and copy its contents to another text file.
8. **Stack Implementation**: Implement Stack with Push and Pop Operations using classes and methods.
9. **Complex Number Addition**: Implement a class for complex numbers and perform addition.
10. **Polymorphism**: Demonstrate polymorphism concepts with shapes (Circle, Triangle, Square) and their respective methods.
11. **Abstract Class Implementation**: Create abstract classes and implement methods for calculating area and perimeter.
12. **Interface Implementation**: Implement an interface for resizing objects.

## Continuous Internal Evaluation (CIE)

The CIE marks for this practical course are split into record/journal (60%) and test (40%). The experiments are evaluated based on conduction, observation, record write-up, and other criteria specified by the faculty.

## Semester End Evaluation (SEE)

SEE marks are conducted jointly by examiners and include evaluation based on write-ups, conduction procedures, results, and viva-voce. Rubrics for evaluation are determined based on course requirements.
